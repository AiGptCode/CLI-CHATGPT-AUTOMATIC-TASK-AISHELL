## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- `curl` (command-line tool)
- An OpenAI API key (set it as an environment variable `OPENAI_KEY`)

## Usage

To use this script, you can run it from the command line with different options and prompts. Here are some examples:

- List available OpenAI models:

  ```

- Perform chat-based completions:
  ```
  python cligpt.py -c "Your chat message here."
  ```

- Perform completion-based generation:
  ```
  python cligpt.py -g "Your generation prompt here."
  ```
