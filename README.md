## Description

This Python script is a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. It allows you to have conversations with the model, generate commands, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- An OpenAI API key (set as an environment variable `OPENAI_KEY`)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatgpt-cli.git
   cd chatgpt-cli
   ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```


## Usage

### Basic Conversation

You can use the script for basic conversations with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. For example:

```
python cligpt.py
```

### Command Generation

You can also use it to generate shell commands. Provide a prompt starting with "command:" like this:

```
python cligpt.py "command: Create a new file in the current directory."
```

### Image Generation

To generate images from text prompts, use the "image:" prefix:

```
python cligpt.py "image: Draw a landscape with a river and mountains."
```

### Other Commands

- `history`: View chat history.
- `models`: List available models.
- `model: MODEL_ID`: Get details for a specific model.
- `exit` or `q`: Quit the script.

## Notes

- Be cautious when executing commands generated by the script, especially if they contain potentially dangerous commands (e.g., `rm`, `wget`). Always understand the commands before running them.

- The script supports multi-line prompts. Press Enter then Ctrl-D to send multi-line prompts.
